% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
To be effective, the introduction should answer the questions ``Why and What For (Four)?" Expanded, these questions are:\cite{Papadakis83}

\subsubsection*{Why is the topic interesting?}

\subsubsection*{What is the background on the previous solutions, if any?}
Veterinary Solutions is ''the largest supplier of veterinary practice management systems in the UK and Ireland."\cite{VetSol} They sells an application called ''RoboVet" that provides:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item an interface that access the computer's local database,
\item an integrated payment solution for atm payments ,
\item an online booking,
\item an auto SMS that sends a reminder of the appointment to the phone of the patient,
\item a postcode address finder that helps pinpoint and verify the home address of the patient,
\item a ''Lablink" that connects lab equipments to the local database,
\item a ''Dragonfly" that stores images from laboratories such as X-rays, CT, MRI, ultrasound, endoscopy, and digital camera for easy access within the RoboVet terminal,
\item a business barometer that creates a statistical analysis of the income generated by the business, and
\item an ''eClaim Manager" that handles paperworks from insurance claims.
\end{itemize}

% STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
\subsection{Statement of the problem}
UPLB Veterinary Clinic as of 2016 has been using jackets with hard copies of information sheets in recording each of their patient's information. These jackets are then stored in a casing which is sorted by name. When a patient enters, their information sheet is manually retrieved from the casings before diagnosis. Keeping each of these information sheet safe can be proven difficult due to is nature as a paper. In a tropical country like the Philippines because of global warming and climate change, keeping these information sheet safe from damage might provides some difficulties.

% OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
\subsection{Objectives of the study}
The general objectives of this paper is to integrate transaction history of patients and clinical activities from different veterinary clinic, and help veterinarians visualize the current status of diseases per location. To achieve the general objectives of this paper: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a single common entry point shall be provided that uses;
\item a single database that can;
\item generalize the current status of diseases per location;
\item provide an online, consultation appointment and;
\item provide an online, schedule for medical missions;
\end{enumerate}
